    <h2>Feeding</h2>
      <p>Crested geckos primarily eat fruit; in the pet trade, you can buy pre-made food called crested gecko diet. It is a powdery substance that comes in bags or bottles usually, and when mixed with water will form a baby food-like soft mush that your gecko will eat. The most recommended brands are Pangea and Repashy.</p>
